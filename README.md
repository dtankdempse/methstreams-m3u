**ðŸ“¢ Notice:** Methstreams has announced that they are taking a break, which means no streams will be listed on their website. As a result, this project is temporarily on hold, and the playlist will not be updated until Methstreams resumes operations.

# MethStreams Live Sports Playlists

MethStreams is a platform that offers free live sports streaming across selected categories. Users can stream and watch sports directly through their browser without the need for an account or subscription.

For added flexibility, this repository provides an M3U playlist featuring MethStreams's channels. With this, you can load the streams into any IPTV application that supports M3U-formatted playlists.

You can view the full list of events provided by MethStreams [here](https://href.li/?https://methstreams.com).
